# NADA

This is a forked repo from `cran/NADA:master` to retain the `NADA`
R-package documentation and code.

No updates or revisions to the code have been made.

## Installation

Since this package is no longer available on CRAN, here is the last
available version.

I am not the author, just a facilitator and working on reviving the
functionality of this package. The development version can be installed
from this repo using:

``` r
install.packages("devtools");# if you do not have it installed on your PC
devtools::install_github("SwampThingPaul/NADA")
```
